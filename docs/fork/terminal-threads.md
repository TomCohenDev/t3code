# Terminal threads

Terminal threads are a feature of the fork [Yarden-zamir/t3code](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/t3code).
For scrollback keys and fish, see [Terminal history](../user/terminal.md). How the feature works
inside: [Terminal threads](features.md#terminal-threads).

A terminal thread is a thread whose screen is a terminal. Use it for an editor, a
CLI agent or a dev server that you want next to your other threads.

Turn on Settings > Terminal > Terminal threads on the server. Then start one like a normal
thread: the terminal button next to New thread in the sidebar, `mod+alt+t`
(`chat.newTerminal`), or New terminal thread in the command palette. The button and the
shortcut follow the same rules as the New thread button. With the boring sidebar on, they start
in the current project. Otherwise, with more than one project, they open the project chooser,
and Shift starts in the current project. The command `chat.newTerminalLocal`
(`mod+alt+shift+n`) starts in the focused project at once.

When you turn the setting off, existing terminal threads stay in the sidebar with their saved
output, read only. They start no shell, and a message or a scheduled task to them fails. A
program that still runs keeps running until it ends or the server restarts.

A new terminal starts as a new thread in Terminal mode: the composer box holds a live
shell, and the Terminal button in the composer is on. The footer shows the folder of the shell. Pick the shell (zsh, bash and
so on, or a custom shell) in place of the model. The first command that ends, or that runs for a second (an
editor, a dev server), makes it a terminal thread with the same shell, named after the
program and subcommand of the command (`git push`, `npm run dev`), or after the shell when the shell does not report its commands. Other parts of the command line, such as values, flags and paths, never show in the name, because the name syncs to every client. A command that starts with a space is not used for the name. The enlarge button next to the hint makes it a terminal thread at once, named after its first command. To skip the draft for New terminal thread in the current project (Shift, `chat.newTerminalLocal` or its command palette entry), turn on Settings > Terminal > Open terminal in current project as a thread. Until then:

- The Terminal button switches back to an agent, and closes the shell.
- A prompt that you typed before switching to Terminal stays in the draft. When the terminal
  becomes a thread, the prompt waits in the project's next new thread.
- Leaving the new thread discards the shell, like an empty new thread.
- The workspace and branch controls under the box work like for a new thread. The shell runs
  in the project folder or in the chosen worktree, and restarts when you change it.
- With New worktree, click Create worktree first. The worktree is set up as for a new
  thread: it fetches origin first when that option is on, and runs the project's setup
  script. The shell starts in the worktree when the setup script starts. A setup script
  that is not async must end first. If that setup script fails, the worktree is removed.
  An async setup script that fails keeps the worktree, and the setup progress shows the failure.
- While the worktree is set up, Cancel stops it, and Work locally runs the shell in the
  project folder instead.

On the phone app, start a new thread in a project, then tap Terminal next to the workspace and
branch controls. A terminal thread needs a project folder, so Terminal shows only when the new
thread has a project. No project counts: its shell runs in the scratch folder. Choose the shell
and the folder: the project folder, an existing worktree, or a new worktree. A new worktree
starts from the base branch of the new thread. Tap Open terminal. The thread starts at once and
opens on the terminal screen. A new worktree shows its setup first, and a setup script that is
not async must end first. If it fails, the setup progress shows the failure. Under Details,
Cancel stops the setup, and Work locally stops it and selects the project folder. Your prompt
stays for the next new thread in the project.

The screen is the header of a normal thread above the terminal. `mod+j` opens the drawer
for more terminals of the thread. The Move to a terminal thread button of the drawer, in a
chat thread or a terminal thread, makes its terminal a new terminal thread. The shell goes on
running there with its output. That shell has no shell integration, so the thread shows
Done or Failed only when the shell exits, and a message to it is only typed. On Linux and Windows, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+N and Ctrl+J
in the main terminal go to the shell, so open the drawer from the header there.

The right panel (`mod+alt+b`) and the thread details (`mod+shift+b`; on Linux and Windows
with the focus outside the terminal) work like in a chat thread: changes and diff, files, pull requests, browser,
devices, machines, and the git actions of the branch. A link that you click in a terminal
opens in the browser of the panel when it is available, like in a chat thread. A terminal
thread has no prompt, so the panel has no "send to chat", no "Add to chat" and no comments on a
diff or a file, and the thread details have no project scripts.

## Messages

A message to a terminal thread, from a scheduled task, an agent or the MCP tools, is typed
into its terminal. The terminal shows exactly what the message said.

- At a prompt, the message is pasted as one command line, then Enter. The run ends with the
  exit code of its last command and the output of all its commands. The message runs in the
  shell itself, so `cd` and `export` stay for the next message.
- A message that is not a complete command, for example one with an open quote, fails, and
  Ctrl+C cancels it in the shell.
- A run ends after 10 minutes. If the command still runs, the reply says so, and the command
  continues in the terminal.
- A message that arrives while a program that you started runs, for example an editor, waits
  for the prompt. If the program still runs after 10 minutes, the run fails and the message is
  not typed.
- A message that you send while a run waits or runs is typed into the program, for example to
  answer a prompt.
- The reply needs the shell integration of the thread. It works with bash 4.4 or newer
  (also Git Bash on Windows) and zsh. With another shell (fish, PowerShell, cmd or a custom
  shell), or after `exec` replaced the shell, the message is only typed, and the reply says
  that no result is captured.
- A message outside full access mode fails.
- A scheduled task with a webhook never types into a terminal thread. Its run fails, also
  when the task or the project default model points to a terminal thread.
- An agent cannot delegate a task to a terminal thread. A thread cannot switch between an agent
  and a terminal; start a new thread instead.

## Sidebar

The sidebar shows the state of a terminal thread until you visit it:

- A bell or an app notification from a program shows Input, also while a program runs and
  after it ends. A bell at the prompt, such as a completion beep, does not.
- A command that ran for 10 seconds or more shows Done when it ends, or Failed when its exit
  code is not zero. A shorter command shows nothing, because you still watch it.
- A program that runs in the shell shows Working. A background job does not.
- A shell that cannot start shows Failed.

A bell, or a command of 10 seconds or more that ends, moves the terminal thread to the top of
the inbox. The folder sidebar sorts threads by the last message that you sent. There, a terminal
thread also moves up at its last bell or ended command.

With Web Push on, a phone also gets a notification for a bell (Input needed) and for a command
of 10 seconds or more that ends (Program done or Program failed).

## Shell exit

When the shell of a terminal thread exits or is killed, the thread keeps its output and
shows that the shell exited, also after a reload. Start a new shell, or press Enter, to
continue; a message to the thread also starts one. To use another shell, choose it next to
Start a new shell first. The new shell starts below the output of the one that ended, under a
"new shell" line. Archiving the thread deletes that
output. While a program runs, Archive waits until you stop it. Delete ends the program, and its
confirm says so. Removing the project ends the programs of its terminal threads, and its confirm
says so too. Settling the thread keeps its shell open. A server restart ends the programs in the
terminal, and the output stays.

## Settings

Settings > Terminal holds the settings of every terminal (zoom limits, key mappings,
app shortcuts, close confirmation and history) and of terminal threads. The terminal font
stays in Appearance > Typography, and Settings > Terminal links to it.

Shells lists the shells that the server found, and your custom shells. A custom shell is any
program with arguments, for example `uv` with `run python`. A program name without a folder
runs from the PATH of the terminal. Settings shows an error under a custom shell whose program the
server cannot find, and the shell pickers mark it as not found. A shell that cannot start shows its error in the terminal;
T3 Code never starts another shell in its place. When you remove or rename a custom shell,
Settings names the threads that use it. Such a thread keeps its output: choose another shell
next to Start a new shell.

## Zoom and keys

On macOS, Cmd+=, Cmd+- and Cmd+0 change the font size of every terminal, within the zoom limits
in Settings > Terminal. Linux and Windows have no zoom keys, because Ctrl+- is undo in shells. Terminal key mappings (Settings > Terminal) send fixed bytes for a key, for
example Cmd+Z as the Kitty sequence that a shell binds.

## History limits

Each terminal keeps up to 5,000 lines and 8 MiB of scrollback on the server. Settings >
Terminal > Terminal history changes both limits, after a server restart.

When a terminal gets wider or narrower, a shell prompt that wraps onto more than one line
can draw over the last line of output. This happens when a draft becomes a terminal thread and
when the right panel opens or closes. The server history still holds the line. A shorter
prompt avoids it.
