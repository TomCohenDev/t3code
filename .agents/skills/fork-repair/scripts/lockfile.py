"""Resolves a pnpm-lock.yaml merge conflict.

It takes the fork lockfile, rebuilds it from the merged package.json files with
`CI=1 vp i --lockfile-only`, and compares the package integrity lines that changed with the ones
that the merged side changed. It stages the lockfile only when both sets are equal. The other
lockfile lines differ between the two sides on purpose: the fork resolves other peer versions.

With --rebuild, it also runs when git merged the lockfile without a conflict, but the text merge
broke it (`vp i --frozen-lockfile` fails with ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_MISSING_DEPENDENCY).
