/**
 * Fork: keybinding sync through the machine map settings (apps/machine-map/SPEC.md, MM-414).
 *
 * The server setting `keybindings` is no settings service field. It is the rule list of
 * `keybindings.json`, which the map reports and applies only while `keybindingSync` is on. The
 * keybindings service watches that file, so a written value reloads like an edit by hand.
 *
 * The value keeps a rule with a command that this build does not know: the keybindings loader
 * skips that rule, and it works after an update. A written value is the decoded value, so it
 * reads back equal and is no local change (MM-404). A write replaces the whole file, so the
 * file before it stays as `keybindings.json.bak`.
