# TomCohenDev fork of T3 Code

This is a personal fork of [pingdotgg/t3code](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code), built on [Yarden-zamir/t3code](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/t3code), whose fork features are listed below. The upstream README starts below the line. Each fork behavior is a setting that starts on when it only adds something, and off when it changes behavior, installs or restarts anything, changes access or needs setup. Settings > Fork shows every fork setting, in the groups of this list. Each line links to its section in [docs/fork/features.md](docs/fork/features.md). Maintainer procedures: [docs/fork/operations.md](docs/fork/operations.md).

## Fork features

**Remote access**

- **[Cloudflare Access login](docs/fork/features.md#cloudflare-access-login):** the server accepts the Cloudflare Access JWT as the owner login.
- **[Request headers per environment](docs/fork/features.md#request-headers-per-environment):** a saved environment sends its own headers, for example a Cloudflare Access service token.
- **[Tunnel pairing](docs/fork/features.md#tunnel-pairing):** a desktop server on loopback makes pairing links with its tunnel URL.
- **[Trusted sibling environments](docs/fork/features.md#trusted-sibling-environments):** one browser page pairs with and reaches the other hosts.

**Machine map** (all lines need `machineMap`, which a join to a map turns on)

- **[Portal](docs/fork/features.md#machine-map):** one portal at `map.tomcohen.dev` maps every T3 machine, adds phones with an app invite, and sets access between them.
- **[Environment name from machine map](docs/fork/features.md#environment-name-from-machine-map):** an optional setting keeps environment names equal to machine map names, also after a name change.
- **[Portal views](docs/fork/features.md#portal-views):** Map, Table, Health, Settings, Queue, Tasks, History, Inbox and Clients.
- **[Join and install](docs/fork/features.md#join-and-install):** "Add machine" shows one command per system that installs the fork and joins.
- **[Join feedback](docs/fork/features.md#join-and-install):** the open join dialog shows when a machine uses the code, and whether it connected.
- **[Emergency pause](docs/fork/features.md#emergency-pause):** a big red button stops all agents and sets all access to none.
- **[Scheduled tasks](docs/fork/features.md#scheduled-tasks):** the Tasks view lists the scheduled tasks of every machine.
- **[Health alerts](docs/fork/features.md#health-alerts):** CPU, memory, disk, swap and battery alerts per machine.
- **[Installable portal](docs/fork/features.md#installable-portal):** the portal installs as an app, with Web Push for alerts.
- **[Settings and theme sync](docs/fork/features.md#settings-and-theme-sync):** a setting with a shared value syncs to every machine, also themes and keybindings.
- **[Settings > Machines](docs/fork/features.md#settings--machines):** join or leave the map, and see the machines that this machine can reach.
- **[Desktop app on the map](docs/fork/features.md#desktop-app-on-the-map):** the desktop app adds each reachable machine as an environment.
- **[Zoom and pan](docs/fork/features.md#zoom-and-pan):** the map zooms, pans and fits all cards, with "Auto layout".
- **[Approved clients](docs/fork/features.md#approved-clients):** a new browser waits until the owner approves it.
- **[Client access](docs/fork/features.md#client-access):** each machine decides which browsers get in through Cloudflare Access; an open browser waits for approval when its access changes.
- **[Owner-only access changes](docs/fork/features.md#owner-only-access-changes):** only the owner changes `clientAccess` and `machineMap`.
- **[Sibling client sessions](docs/fork/features.md#sibling-client-sessions):** a browser client session lasts 1 day, also on sibling machines.
- **[App invites and app tokens](docs/fork/features.md#app-invites-and-app-tokens):** "Invite an app" shows a QR code that a native app uses once.
- **[Machines panel](docs/fork/features.md#machines-panel):** a read-only map in the right panel of a thread.
- **[Continue on another machine](docs/fork/features.md#continue-on-another-machine):** continue a thread on another machine while its own machine is offline, from an optional thread backup.

- **[Open workspace with a checkout](docs/fork/features.md#open-workspace-with-a-checkout):** the desktop open-workspace request accepts a checkout.

## Fork fixes

- Themes: border width and radius flow through Tailwind tokens. Composer backdrop, outline and banners follow the theme radius. One theme shadow for nested surfaces and for split buttons.
- MCP: `schedule_task`, `t3_project_create` and `t3_project_update` read and write the project model, environment mode, auto-pull and actions through project settings.
- Desktop updates: the updater never downgrades, so a local build stays installed. The server recovers when quit-and-install does not quit.
- Worktree launch: a worktree request in Scratch runs in a thread folder. A worktree request outside a Git repository runs in the project folder and says so in the thread. A launch refuses a new worktree branch that already exists.
- Queue: a resumed queued turn shows after the turns that ran before it. A paused queue shows while a turn runs. Resume waits for an edit and for a usage limit. Send now on a stopped thread also waits for a usage limit.
- Machine map: an expired machine arrow ends the sessions that it granted.
- Device panel: a Homebrew Android SDK (`android-commandlinetools`) works without `ANDROID_HOME`, also when the `adb` on `PATH` has no emulator.

# T3 Code

T3 Code is an "agent harness control surface". It enables control of the agents on your machine with a best-in-class mobile app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t3-code-remote-claude-more/id6787819824), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t3tools.t3code)), [web app](https://app.t3.codes) and [Electron-based desktop app](https://t3.codes).

Works with your subscriptions on Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Google Antigravity. If they're set up on your computer, T3 Code can control them.

## "Wait, what are you selling me?"

Nothing. We built T3 Code because we wanted the best possible development experience with agents. We were inspired by existing solutions like the Codex desktop app, Conductor, Claude Desktop and Cursor Glass, but none met our bar.

We wanted something performant, remote-ready, and truly open. If we ever go the wrong direction, we want you to have everything you need to fork and build the editor that you want.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> T3 Code currently supports Codex, Claude, Cursor, Grok Build, OpenCode, and Antigravity. Install and authenticate at least one provider before use:
>
> - Codex: install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`
> - Claude: install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code) and run `claude auth login`
> - Cursor: install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli) and run `agent login`
> - Grok Build: install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli) and run `grok login`
> - OpenCode: install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) and run `opencode auth login`
> - Antigravity: enable it in Settings, then use **Install Antigravity** and **Sign in with Google**. No CLI is required.

### Command line

```bash
curl -fsSL https://t3.codes/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, in PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://t3.codes/install.ps1 | iex
```

Then run `t3` to start the server and open the local web app. `t3 service install` keeps it running in the background, `t3 update` moves to a newer release, and `t3 --help` has the full reference.

To try it once without installing, run `npx t3@latest` instead.

### Desktop app

Install the latest version of the desktop app from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases), or from your favorite package registry:

#### Windows (`winget`)

```bash
winget install T3Tools.T3Code
```

#### Windows (`scoop`)

```bash
scoop install extras/t3code
```

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install --cask t3-code
```

#### Debian, Ubuntu (`.deb`)

Download the `.deb` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/pingdotgg/t3code/releases), then:

```bash
sudo apt install ./T3-Code-*.deb
```

#### Arch Linux (AUR)

Stable:

```bash
yay -S t3code-bin
```

Nightly:

```bash
yay -S t3code-nightly-bin
```

The AUR packaging is maintained in this repository under [`packaging/aur`](./packaging/aur).

### Install `vp`

T3 Code uses Vite+ so you'll need to install the global `vp` command-line tool.

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vite.plus | bash
```

#### Windows

```bash
irm https://vite.plus/ps1 | iex
```
