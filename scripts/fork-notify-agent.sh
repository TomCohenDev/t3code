# failed reached no agent. Pull request runs never notify, so they do not count.
# Stay below Fork Sync's 2-hour interval: skipped calls also have a successful notify
# job, so a longer window could silence every scheduled failure in a chain.
# Limit: a repair that takes more than 90 minutes can get another call on the next sync.
